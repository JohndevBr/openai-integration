# OpenAI Integration README.md

## Overview
This project demonstrates an integration with the OpenAI API, specifically designed to interact with the GPT-3.5 model. It includes scripts to handle requests and responses to the OpenAI API, enabling users to send messages and receive AI-generated text completions.

## Files
- `page.js`: Contains the frontend logic for sending requests to the backend.
- `route.js`: Manages the backend POST request to the OpenAI API, including error handling and response formatting.

## Setup
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. **Dependencies**: Install necessary packages via `npm install`.
3. **API Key**: Set your OpenAI API key in your environment variables as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Usage
- Use the `page.js` file to create a user interface for inputting messages.
- The `route.js` file should be set up on the server-side to handle the POST request:
  - Extracts the user message from the request body.
  - Sends the message to the OpenAI API.
  - Handles errors and formats the response to send back to the client.

## Example Request
```js
fetch('/api/path', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Your message here' })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Error Handling
The integration includes basic error handling for HTTP errors and API communication errors, ensuring robust interaction with the OpenAI API.
